I began my career in education as a puppeteer in a disability awareness education programme. Since then I have taught both general primary school and specialist drama in a variety of educational settings. I discovered process drama through my studies in the Postgraduate diploma in Education and went on to gain my Masters in Education at the University of Sydney. I am currently completing my doctorate and remain deeply passionate about education and the potential for drama as both an aesthetic artform and an effective pedagogy.

My doctoral thesis ‘Dancing through the fourth wall’, explores the potential relationship between the principals of critical pedagogy and process drama. Through the metaphor of dance it interrogates the capability of process drama to provide an embodied form of critical pedagogy. Positing that the ambiguities and uncertainties available within the dramatic world provide a playful space within which social constructions of identity and power may be challenged.
